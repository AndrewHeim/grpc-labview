# SSL/TLS Support

You can enable SSL/TLS support on the server by passing in a path to a certificate and private key for the server.

You can generate the certificate with openssl using the following script.

```
mypass="password123"

echo Generate server key:
openssl genrsa -passout pass:$mypass -des3 -out server.key 4096

echo Generate server signing request:
openssl req -passin pass:$mypass -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj  "/C=US/ST=TX/L=Austin/O=NI/OU=labview/CN=localhost"

echo Self-sign server certificate:
openssl x509 -req -passin pass:$mypass -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -set_serial 01 -out server.crt

echo Remove passphrase from server key:
openssl rsa -passin pass:$mypass -in server.key -out server.key

rm server.csr
```

Clients then must connect using the server certificate that was generated (server.cer) otherwise the connection will fail.

If you do not passing in a certificate then the server will use insecure gRPC.
